• Solved SumUp compatibility issue which caused extremely long receipts to be printed
• Added initial support for Goojprt PT2x0 printers (also known as MTP-II)

Known issues:
• Make sure Bluetooth is enabled when print jobs start, since the driver isn’t yet able to handle that properly. This will be fixed in the next version.
