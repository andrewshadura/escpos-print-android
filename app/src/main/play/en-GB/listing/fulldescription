Have a portable 58mm Bluetooth thermal printer? This app allows you to directly print to it from your Android device.

This app just provides a Print Service to Android. This means that once it’s installed, you have to enable it from your ‘Print’ section of the settings app of you device.

It is optimised and primarily aimed at printing receipts, but is generic enough to allow printing a wide range of text documents.
